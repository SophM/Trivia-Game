### Trivia Game

1. The player presses a "start" button to start the game - So when the "start" button is pressed, the timer and the first question + possible answers are displayed.

2. The questions are displayed one at a time - they are displayed as long as the timer is running.

3. The player has then a limited amount of time to asnwer each question.

4. There are two possible ways to pass on to the next question:
        - the player runs out of time to answer.
        - the player answers.

5. Passing on to the next question (no matter the reason) is automatic.

6. If the player answers, there are two possible outcomes:
        - the answer is correct.
        - the answer is incorrect.

7. If the answer is correct, we display a "congrats" message with a little pic/gif/something.

8. If the answer is incorrect, we display a "you're wrong" message with a little pic/gif/something.

9. When all the questions have been asked, we get the "final" screen that displays a little message saying the game is over, the number of correct answers, the number of incorrect answers, the number of unanswered questions and a button to start over.
