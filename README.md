# DNA Trivia Game

In this project, I built a trivia game, whose theme is DNA. I might end up changing career but one never forget their first passion! The player clicks the "start" button to launch the game: the timer (displayed) starts running and the first question and the corresponding possible answers are displayed.

This game has a responsive layout and can be played on different devices!

The player has 15 seconds to answer each question. If she/he ran out of time, the correct asnwer, a little message and a gif are displayed automatically. If she/he chose the correct answer, a "congrats" message and a gif are displayed. If she/he chose the wrong answer, a "you're wrong" message and a gif are displayed. After a few seconds, the timer starts again automatically, and the next question and corresponding possible answers are displayed automatically.
 
When there is no more question to answer, a summary of the results - number of correct answers, incorrect answers and unsanswered questions - is displayed along with a little message and a "start over" button to start the quizz over if desired. The player doesn't need to refresh the page to start over.
